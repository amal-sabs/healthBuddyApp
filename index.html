                    <h3>A UX Case Study on improving adherence and care coordination</h3>
                    <p>
                        Chronic health conditions require continuous management that often extends beyond the doctor’s office and into people’s daily lives. For many patients, this includes following strict medication schedules, monitoring symptoms, and regular doctor appointments. Despite the obvious importance of these routines, maintaining them can be difficult. Factors such as busy schedules, forgetfulness, complex medication regimens, unclear instructions, and limited organizational tools often lead to missed medication doses or even delayed care. In fact, some patients may also struggle to remember whether they have already taken their medication, increasing the risk of accidental double dosing or skipped treatments. These challenges not only affect individual health outcomes but also place additional strain on healthcare systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        Caregivers also play a crucial role in supporting individuals with chronic conditions. They are often responsible for coordinating appointments, managing multiple medications, and ensuring adherence to treatment plans. This responsibility can become overwhelming and stressful. As a result, there is a clear need for solutions that support both patients and caregivers in a way that is simple, reliable, and easy to integrate into everyday routines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        One such solution is using digital tools to support health management. In fact, mobile applications have become essential for tracking habits, setting reminders, and improving behavioral consistency. While existing solutions such as <a href="https://calciumhealth.com/medication-manager-calcium-super-app/">Calcium Health</a> offer advanced, data-driven approaches to medication management, they often prioritize analytics and clinical integration over everyday usability. However, these platforms can become complex and overwhelming, especially for people who are less comfortable with technology or who simply need quick, reliable support in their daily routines. Thus, this project focuses on a patient-centered approach. It emphasizes on simplicity, clarity, and accessibility for both patients and caregivers. The app is designed to seamlessly fit into users’ lives, addressing common challenges such as forgetfulness, routine management, and coordination of care. While it may not yet include advanced integrations or AI-driven insights, its strength lies in its intuitive design and its ability to support real user needs in a practical and approachable way. A strong emphasis is placed on simplicity, clarity, and trust, ensuring that users can rely on the app without feeling overwhelmed or confused.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        The objective of this UX design process is to create a user-centered solution that addresses real user needs and pain points. Through methods such as user research, persona development, user journey mapping, prototyping, and usability testing, this project seeks to deeply understand user behaviors and design an experience that fits naturally into their daily lives. Special attention is given to accessibility, ease of navigation, and reducing cognitive load. Ultimately, this case study demonstrates how thoughtful and research-driven UX design can transform a complex and often stressful health management process into a more structured and supportive experience.

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <div class="research-text">
                    <p>
                        The goal of the user research is to understand the needs, challenges, and behaviors of individuals living with chronic health conditions, as well as caregivers who may assist in managing medications and medical appointments.
                        The research aims to identify common pain points in medication adherence, appointment management, and communication with healthcare professionals. 
                        The insights described below provide a strong foundation for design priorities for this app.
                        This research is conducted through the review of academic articles, healthcare studies, and industry insights on medication adherence, mobile health applications, and user behavior. 
                        Reviewing existing literature ensures that the app design properly aligns with established healthcare and real-world challenges. 
                        Articles discussing challenges faced by individuals with chronic illnesses would provide industry and medical context. 
                        This research helps validate the needs of the users. 
                        <br><br>
                        From the research, it is found that mobile health applications have been increasing in adoption. 
                        A recent analysis found a significant rise in health and fitness app usage, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, where health tracking and behavior change tools saw higher downloads and user engagement <a href="https://esmed.org/post-pandemic-trends-in-mobile-health-applications/">[1]</a>. 
                        This trend supports the viability of a medication management app, suggesting the market readiness and receptivity to such a tool. 
                        However, despite this growth, several barriers continue to limit long-term adoption.
                        A scoping review of problems and barriers identified usability, integration into daily, technology challenges, data security concerns, and lack of personalization as recurring obstacles <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10221513/">[2]</a>. 
                        This highlights the importance of designing an app that is easy to use, intuitive and seamlessly fits into users’ routines. 
                        <br><br>
                        Medication adherence remains a critical global issue. 
                        Research shows that 50% of patients with conditions do not follow their medication regimens as prescribed, leading to poorer health outcomes and increased healthcare costs <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3068890/">[3]</a>. 
                        According to the American Medical Association, patients often do not take prescribed medications for a variety of reasons. 
                        Medication-taking behavior is complex and multifaceted, because it is highly influenced by patient understanding and regimen complexity <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/ama-steps-forward-program/8-reasons-patients-dont-take-their-medications">[4]</a>. 
                        Solutions must therefore be multifactorial, combining reminders with clear instructions, educational context, and feedback loops rather than relying on reminders alone. 
                        The app must be an effective reminder system surrounded by education, transparency, and motivational design. 
                        <br><br>
                        Additional studies also show that reminder systems alone are not always effective. 
                        Research suggests that while reminders can improve short-term adherence, their effectiveness decreases over time if they are not meaningful or well-integrated into users’ routines <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK260109/">[5]</a>. 
                        Users may begin to ignore notifications, especially if they are too frequent or poorly timed. 
                        From a UX perspective, reminder fatigue is a well-documented issue. 
                        A study published on Medium highlights that users often dismiss or ignore reminders when they become repetitive, intrusive, or lack contextual relevance <a href="https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/do-reminder-apps-ever-remind-you-a-ux-research-study-46cb356a241e">[6]</a>. 
                        Poorly designed reminders can feel like interruptions rather than helpful support, reducing engagement and long-term usage.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall, the research demonstrates that effective medication management solutions must be multifactorial. 
                        While reminders are essential, they must be supported by clear and simple user interfaces and educational content to improve understanding. 
                        Therefore, the proposed application must function not only as a reminder system, but as a comprehensive, user-centered health management tool that supports consistency, reduces cognitive load, and builds long-term user trust.

                        The <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/AnalysisPage.aspx?AnalyzerToken=BeK7BXXQjwLf6nggNri1MTiNqvQrwjPn&id=hfFpVS_SE06YUM5bGrzS6P_CwqMSi8FEtBg-NwCDC0tUQzQ2U1NVR1VCUTFWQ0s2NzI1VFNHT1FGVy4u">survey results</a> indicate that the majority of participants were aged 35 and above. Most respondents reported managing their own chronic conditions, while a smaller group identified as caregivers responsible for managing medications for others. It is why it is important to design a solution that accommodates both independent users and caregivers, particularly those who may be less comfortable with technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of medication habits, most participants take medication on a daily basis, with several requiring multiple doses per day. While some reported rarely missing a dose, a large portion indicated that they sometimes or often forget. The most frequent reasons for missed doses include forgetfulness, busy schedules, changes in routine, and side effects. This reinforces the need for a system that adapts to real-life variability rather than relying solely on fixed reminders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Participants currently rely on a mix of strategies such as phone alarms, written notes, memory, and assistance from others. Despite the availability of mobile solutions, not all users feel comfortable with apps, and several respondents reported limited experience or low confidence in using them. Among those who had used health apps before, common frustrations included hard navigation, poor accessibility (small text, confusing layouts) and complicated interfaces. These findings highlight the importance of designing an app that is simple, intuitive, and accessible to users with varying levels of digital literacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When asked about desired features, participants consistently prioritized medication reminders, medication tracking, and clear medication information, along with simple setup processes. The overwhelming majority rated ease of use as “very important”. This shows that simplicity is a critical design requirement. Emotionally, many users reported feeling stressed, overwhelmed, or anxious when managing their medications. This means that the app should not only support task completion but also reduce cognitive and emotional burden.

            <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                <div class="research-text">
                    <p>
                        A usability test was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and ease of use of the mobile application prototype designed to support medication management and appointment scheduling. The primary goal of this testing was to assess how easily users could complete key tasks, while identifying potential usability issues such as confusion, navigation difficulties, and cognitive overload. 
                        <br><br>
                        The test involved 5 participants representing the target audience, including people who manage their own medications as well as caregivers responsible for others. A moderated testing approach was used where participants interacted with a clickable prototype and were encouraged to think aloud while completing assigned tasks. This method allowed for the observation of user behavior, decision-making processes, and emotional responses in real time. 
                        <br><br>
                        Participants were asked to complete three main tasks. The first task required users to set up a medication reminder by entering details of their reminder, including a title, the time and the frequency of the reminder. The second task involved booking a medical appointment, where users selected an appointment and booked it. The last task was to add the information of one of their medications to receive a summary of the drug, which includes its purpose and side effects. During these tasks, data was collected through direct observation, notes on user behaviour, and verbal feedback, alongside qualitative insights such as user frustration, hesitation, and confidence. 
                        <br><br>
                        Following the test, the collected data was analysed by grouping usability issues into common categories such as navigation challenges, unclear interface elements, and feature gaps. Patterns across participants were identified to distinguish between major and minor issues. Based on these findings, improvements were proposed. This ensured that the design evolves in response to real user needs, ultimately enhancing usability and overall user experience.

            <h3>User Feedback</h3>
            <div class="research-text">
                <p>
                    The usability testing provided valuable insights into user expectations and areas for improvement within the application. One key suggestion was the addition of notification preview feature, allowing users to see exactly how reminders would appear before confirming them. This was perceived as a way to increase clarity and reduce uncertainty about whether reminders were set correctly. Participants also expressed the need for better integration between appointments and the calendar view. Specifically, they wanted already booked appointments to be clearly displayed within the calendar interface. This enables a more holistic and organized view of their schedule. Another commonly identified improvement was the ability to separate completed and pending reminders. Users indicated that distinguishing between these states would help them better track adherence and avoid confusion. Additionally, one participant suggested adding a checkmark to indicate that the reminder is complete, rather than just change the color of the reminder. Overall, the feedback highlighted the importance of clarity, organization, and contextual information in supporting users’ health management routines. These insights helped guide the next design.

                The UX design process played a critical role in uncovering real user needs and shaping a solution that goes beyond basic functionality. Through research, personas, and usability testing, it became clear that users were not only struggling with remembering tasks, but also with managing complex routines and understanding their own health behaviors. One of the main challenges encountered during the design process was balancing simplicity with functionality. While users needed features such as medication tracking, reminders, and appointment scheduling, introducing too many options quickly made the interface feel overwhelming. This challenge was addressed by prioritizing clarity, reducing unnecessary steps, and focusing on intuitive design. Another challenge was to try to accomplish an intuitive design. What is intuitive for me, a software engineering student, is definitely not intuitive for an old man who has a low-tech level. However, the usability tests conducted on various people helped receive feedback and ensure that the flow of the app is smooth. The testing also revealed gaps that were not initially considered, such as the need for notification previews and better organization of completed tasks. Overall, this process reinforced the importance of user-centered design and demonstrated how continuous feedback can significantly improve both usability and user satisfaction.
